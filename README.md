# RSA_project

Install [NTL library](https://libntl.org/doc/tour-unix.html) on your machine. if you don't use visual studio to compile, you can use wsl and virtual machine to compile with vscode 

### Usecases
* Implement program takes the number of bits for the prime numbers as input (from input.txt), generates two prime numbers (observer thourgh output.txt), and uses them to create an RSA encryption. 
* Test encrypt and decrypt with keys from the RSA algorithm via a text message
* Implement from scratch some arithmetic related algorithms such as: power_mod, gcd, euler_gcd, chinese_remainder_theorem, rabin_miller test, ... to assist in the problem of the topic.
* Implement a few common rsa attacks such as an external attack, internal attack, broadcast attack, and fermat attack on a case-by-case basis.
